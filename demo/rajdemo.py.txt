## Python Program to Find the Area of a Triangle

### Description

This Python program calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length `a`, `b`, and `c` is given by:

```
area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
```

where `s` is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, defined as:

```
s = (a + b + c) / 2
```

### Usage

To use this program, you can either:

- **Provide input values:** Uncomment the lines that start with `#` to take the side lengths as input from the user.
- **Use predefined values:** Leave the predefined values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as they are.

### Example

If you provide the following input values:

```
a = 5
b = 6
c = 7
```

The program will output:

```
The area of the triangle is 14.70
```

### Code

```python
# Python Program to find the area of triangle

# Predefined side lengths
a = 5
b = 6
c = 7

# Uncomment below to take inputs from the user
# a = float(input('Enter first side: '))
# b = float(input('Enter second side: '))
# c = float(input('Enter third side: '))

# calculate the semi-perimeter
s = (a + b + c) / 2

# calculate the area
area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)
```
