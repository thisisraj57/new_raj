**Class:** `AccountManagementApplication`

**Description:**

The `AccountManagementApplication` class is the main application class for a Spring Boot application that provides account management functionality. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which indicates that it is the main class of a Spring Boot application and that it should be scanned for annotated components.

**Method:**

* `public static void main(String[] args)`:

    This is the main method of the application. It is the entry point of the application and is responsible for starting the Spring Boot application. It calls the `SpringApplication.run()` method to start the application.

**Usage:**

To use this class, you can create a new Spring Boot project and add the following code to the main application class:

```java
public class MyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

You can then run the application by executing the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application and make it listen for HTTP requests on port 8080 by default.
